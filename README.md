## What is this?

I've always been interested in "2.5D" racing games in the style of Outrun. I stumbled upon [this great example](https://github.com/ChazyChazZz/PyxelRoadDemo), which uses the pyxel python game engine, and decided to mess around on it as a part of learning how all the 2D project stuff works.

The theme is based on Groom Lake, the site of the infamous Area 51.  

The track is randomly generated.  

Contributions are welcome if anyone wants to help build upon this!
