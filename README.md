## What is this?

I've always been interested in "2.5D" racing games in the style of Outrun. I stumbled upon [this example](https://github.com/ChazyChazZz/PyxelRoadDemo), which uses the pyxel python game engine, and decided to build upon it.

The theme is based on Groom Lake, the site of the infamous Area 51. 

## Controls
WSAD

## Run

Run with:
`python3 main.py`
or
`DEBUG=1 python3 main.py` to get some debug info

## Requirements:
1. Python >= 3.10
2. [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) >= 1.9.18
